# Audio Bar Visualizer 

A simple project I took on to check how does the Web Audio API work. Will probably be devloped futher.

TODOs:
- documentation
- more configuration options
- responsiveness
- nicer curve

The preview page with some example song by Kevin MacLeod is available [here](https://bartor.github.io/audio-bar-visualizer/);
